## This is an example README.md file for my to-do list repository

This file will contain instructions on how to use the to-do-app.


use .gitignore file and add node_modules and .env file in it so that they do not get pushed into github


#PROBLEM: .env is not being able to get accessed in the server.js file for the PORT and the .gitignore is not working for some reason(I forgot to add it at the beginning; and all the node_modules were pushed to origin/main
          then I added the .gitignore file but apparantly it has not been working)
